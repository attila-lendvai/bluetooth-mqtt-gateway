## Status

It's an abandoned proof of concept.

## What

A bluetooth <-> MQTT gateway written in Common Lisp.

It's written in a way that it can be compiled by
[ECL](https://common-lisp.net/project/ecl/) and it can run on a small
OpenWRT router, or other tiny devices.

## Why

It was part of a project that I was involved in at around 2015, but
the project was discontinued.

The reason I'm publishing it is that it serves as an example for
[hu.dwim.bluez](https://github.com/hu-dwim/hu.dwim.bluez).
